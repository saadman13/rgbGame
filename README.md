R-Red G-Green B-Blue

Fun Game to practice your identification skill of rgb colors. Food for thought - what's rgb(255,255,255)? Surprised? Haha :)

Game Decription:

It randomly generates and displays a rgb(i,j,k) where i,j,k are integers between 0-255,and displays several squares of different colors, one of those squares is of the right color, then the user has to click on the square which they think is of the right color. The number of random squares that are displayed, depends on the level of difficulty chosen by the user. There are 3 difficulty levels - Easy,Medium and Hard, I also added a performance functionality where the user can see how they did; For example, if there were 6 squares of different colors and they got the right color on the 3rd click, then their performance is 50%. Users can change to new colors, if they don't like the current color. They can also have a sneak peak at the solution by clicking on a button, which turns itself into the right color when clicked.
